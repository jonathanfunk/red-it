## Learning Experience
After working with HTML5/CSS3 for over three months, I'm stepping into very new territory. React was very intimidating to me at first but after a while it's starting to make sense. I'm starting to get more comfortable working with components and props.

Redux was even more intimidating but after a while it started to make sense as well. I'm starting to see how nifty it is for managing state. This is something I would like to practice with more.

I got introduced to back-end web developing working with Node.js and Express. I can fetch data from the server using RESTful methods that create a link between the server side and client side.
